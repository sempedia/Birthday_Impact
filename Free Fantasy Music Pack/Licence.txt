Hi!

Thank you for you interest in checking out my free music. 

There is a total of 25 original soundtracks (1:00:54 total of music!) to be used in

RPG and Fantasy video game projects.

They're all free but I'd highly appreciate if you give me attribution and credit me as "Fictium Sound Design".

I might be updating this free fantasy music pack in the future so there might be more!

Happy game development!

Technical Details:

* 16 Bit Wav.
* Most of them loop however some of them are "complete" music.
* It fits fantasy, rpg, dark fantasy, and horror video games.
